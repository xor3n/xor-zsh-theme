<p align="center">xor, a minimalistic and feature-poor zsh theme</p>

# Installation
If you use the oh-my-zsh zsh framework, you can simply run `git clone https://github.com/xor3n/xor-zsh-theme.git /home/$USER/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/xor-zsh-theme/`, after that you can just set the ZSH_THEME in your .zshrc to "xor-zsh-theme/xor"

# *maybe* TODO



more colors

add a gif to this readme

think of a better RPROMPT that doesn't say something stupid like "take your meds schizo, t. hostname" or add guide to customize it

make this readme better

*maybe* add the ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_DIRTY and ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_CLEAN info thing if i can make it cool-looking

the "››" arrow thing looks dumb with a lot of fonts so make a variant where it uses the "»" this thing or greater than symbol or something
